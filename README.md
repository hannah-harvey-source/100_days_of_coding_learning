# 100_days_of_coding_learning
# I want to enhance my coding skills
# so over the course of 100 days I will be creating projects
# The first is going to be copied from an instagram post
# I will then try to complete so other projects from my own
# skills so far

# I will also be pushing this to a repo on github
# I am going to push every day 
# I am going to pull every morning
# this should hopefully then enhance my understanding and 
# help me to improve my command prompt skills

# I will create README.md files so I am journal my experience.
